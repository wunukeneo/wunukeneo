## Inventions
1.	Biodiesel
Development of a model equation for the optimization of biodiesel process variables for maximal yield.

Several production process variables play a role in the eventual yield of biodiesel. The goal is to optimize these variables and obtain the best yield. I have successfully used the Box-Behnken design process variable method to optimize the reaction temperature, time and catalyst to develop a model equation capable of determining the optimum operating ratios of the process variables for the highest biodiesel yield. The equation was deployed to improve the yield of Jatropha Biodiesel obtained through transesterification of the Jatropha Curcas crude using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 6751 standard specification. A maximum yield of 98.5% was obtained for 60oC, 90 min, and 1% wt vol of the temperature, time and catalyst respectively. The developed equation is thus presented.

Y = -10.365x + 2.396y + 233.808z ‚Äì 0.077x2 ‚Äì 0.010y2+- 98.467z2 ‚Äì 0.005xy ‚Äì 0.275yz ‚Äì 0.217xz

Where; x = temperature (oC)
             y = time (min)
             z = catalyst (% wt vol)
             Y = yield (% vol)
The equation can be used to model a similar optimization design for multiple biodiesel feedstock other than Jatropha and cut down on production time and cost for ease of commercialization.

Development of Biodiesel from a combination of feedstock
To address the issue of improving the quality of biodiesel produced from single-plant feedstock, the innovation is to produce biodiesels from a combination of feedstock for high performance while at the same time mitigating carbon emissions. The idea is to use the strength of one of the feedstocks to offset the weakness of the other. I have successfully developed biodiesel from a combination of Jatropha and Neem oils mixed at 50:50 to obtain a fine-rate Jatropha-Neem oil biodiesel fuel. The fuel was also produced in blended forms with conventional diesel at different ratios expertly using state-of-the-art methods. The biodiesels were tested with remarkable success in Internal Combustion Engines with minor modifications to the engines and can be patented and commercialized. A picture of the biodiesels is presented in Plate 1, and the description of the fuels and oils are presented in Table 1.

Design, Construction, and Testing of Portable Gasifier
To further demonstrate the practical applicability of my biodiesel, I constructed a gasifier for its everyday use. The Downdraft Gasifier was constructed and tested. The producer gas generated by the Gasifier was of good quality with a minimal amount of contaminant gases.
